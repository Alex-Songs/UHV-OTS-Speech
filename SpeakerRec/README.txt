This is the demo scripts for running the benchmarking test or run with real project data.
This folder is developped from speechbrain recipe VoxCeleb/SpeakerRec. But we made this speaker verification task into a speaker ID task. 

./download.sh is to download the VoxCeleb datasets and stored at /data/

./run_test.py is runing the benchmark test on a specific public dataset using the model included in this folder, and generate the performance evaluation in corresponding metric.
